# React 19 exploring

In this exploration, we will be diving into the new features of React 19, specifically focusing on the `useActionState` Hook.

The `useActionState` Hook is a powerful tool that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action. It provides a convenient way to handle form submissions and update the state of your React components accordingly.

By using `useActionState`, you can easily manage the state of your form inputs and handle any actions triggered by the form submission. This Hook simplifies the process of updating state and provides a clean and concise way to handle form-related logic.

## Running the project

1. Install project dependencies using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will start the Vite development server and your React project will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

That's it! You have successfully installed and run a Vite + React project using pnpm.
